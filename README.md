Manage a dynamic home IP address with an AWS hosted route53 domain

# setup

In order to use this tool, you need to set up authentication credentials. Credentials for your AWS account can be found in the [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home). You can create or use an existing user or follow the instructions below to setup a new user.

## IAM policy
Create a [new IAM policy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/policies$new?step=edit) using [ddns_iam_policy.json](ddns_iam_policy.json) as a base. Remember to replace `{YOUR_ZONE_ID_HERE}` with the Hosted Zone ID for the route53 domain you want to update.

Give your policy a meaningful name and description, you'll need to refer to it in the next section.

## IAM user
Create a [new IAM user](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/users$new?step=details), give it a user name, and select **Programmatic access** for the access type.

Next, select **Attach existing policies directly**, find the IAM policy you just created, and click the checkbox to the right of the policy name to attach it to your user.

To see your new access key, choose **Show**. Your credentials will look something like this:

    Access key ID: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
    Secret access key: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY

To download the key pair, choose **Download .csv file**. Store the keys in a secure location.

## AWS credentials
If you have the AWS CLI installed, then you can use it to configure your credentials file:

    aws configure --profile ddns
Alternatively, you can create the credential file yourself. By default, its location is at ~/.aws/credentials:

    [ddns]
    aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
    aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY

By default, `dns_update.py` will use the **ddns** credential profile. You can change this by issuing the `--profile PROFILE` option.

# usage
```
usage: dns_update.py [-h] [--profile PROFILE] --domain DOMAIN
                     [--record RECORD] [--zone ZONE] [--ttl TTL]
